# üìù MentorBaba Internship Assignment: Smart Resume Screener (AI for HR)

## Objective  
As a MentorBaba intern, your goal is to build a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a resume matches a job description. This exercise will give you hands-on experience with **text processing, embeddings, and classification**, while introducing practical HR-AI applications.

---

## Background  
Recruiters often spend hours screening resumes. Automating resume screening not only **saves time** but also ensures **the right candidates are identified**. This assignment exposes you to a real-world problem in AI for HR, while allowing creativity in your solution.

## Instructions  

### Step 1 ‚Äì Dataset Preparation  
- Create a small dummy dataset with **10‚Äì15 pairs** of:  
  - Job Description (JD) text  
  - Resume text  
  - Label (1 = Match, 0 = No Match)  
- Example:  
```
JD: "Looking for a Python developer with experience in ML and AWS."
Resume: "Experienced Python engineer skilled in ML, cloud computing, and AWS."
Label: 1
```

### Step 2 ‚Äì Text Preprocessing  
- Clean the text by:  
  - Lowercasing  
  - Removing punctuation and special characters  
  - Optional: removing stopwords  
- Convert the text into **numerical representations**:  
  - TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, or simple embeddings  

### Step 3 ‚Äì Model Training  
- Choose a classification model: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or a simple Neural Network.  
- Train the model to predict whether a resume matches a JD.

### Step 4 ‚Äì Evaluation  
- Evaluate your model using:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Display a **confusion matrix** for clarity.

### Step 5 ‚Äì Prediction on New Data  
- Test your model with at least **2 new JD-resume pairs**.  
- Show predicted match/no-match results.

### Step 6 ‚Äì Creative Add-On (Optional)  
- Build a simple **dashboard (Streamlit/Flask)** to:  
  - Upload a JD and a resume text file  
  - Output a **match score** (probability of match)  
- You can also visualize **feature importance** or similarities for extra learning.

## Deliverables  
1. **Jupyter Notebook** with clean, commented code.  
2. **Summary of results**: evaluation metrics, predictions, and insights.  
3. Optional: screenshot or demo of your dashboard if implemented.

## MentorBaba Notes  
- Keep your dataset small initially to **focus on preprocessing and modeling**.  
- The key learning is **feature extraction from unstructured text**.  
- Dashboard and visualization are optional but encouraged for creativity.  
- You can experiment with **different embeddings** (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT) once the basic workflow is complete.
